# starter-chrome-extension
My starter kit for Chrome extension projects, based on React, MobX, CSS Modules and TypeScript.

It provides a skeleton popup page, options page and a background page.

This kit consists of the latest versions of:
* React
* Webpack
* MobX
* SCSS
* CSS Modules
* TypeScript

#### Build Instructions

`yarn install`

`yarn run build`

The extension asset files are created at `/build/`.
Load "unpacked extension" in Chrome to test it out!
